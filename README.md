# Proxy Wrapper

A working example of https://github.com/villadora/express-http-proxy

## Install

```
yarn
```

## To run

for running the need to set `PROXY_TARGET` to domain that you would like to use. For example

```
PROXY_TARGET=www.google.com yarn start
```

On local you can pass PORT as well else it defaults to 3000
